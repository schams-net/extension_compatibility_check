Extension Compatibility Check
=============================

Quick Summary
-------------

TYPO3 CMS extension to check the compatibility status of currently installed extensions in TYPO3 CMS 6.2 LTS.


Description
-----------

The official maintenance period of TYPO3 CMS version 6.2 LTS ends in March 2017. Many agencies, TYPO3 integrators and website owners face the challenge to upgrade their existing 6.2 instances to the new TYPO3 CMS version 7.6 LTS. In many cases, updating the TYPO3 core is not a problem. However, extensions are often not maintained the same way as the TYPO3 core some extensions are not 7.6 compatible.

The `EXT:extension_compatibility_check` extension supports integrators in the process prior executing the upgrade. Installed in a TYPO3 CMS 6.2 system, the extension allows backend administrators to run a check which extensions are compatible, which extensions require an update and which extensions need to be replaced (e.g. because no 7.6 compatible version exists).

It is important to understand that this extension does not modify, update or replace any existing extensions. The purpose of this extension is to make the TYPO3 upgrade process easy and straight forward by generating a report which actions are required prior the TYPO3 upgrade.
