Known Issues
============


PHP Version 5.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 CMS 6.2 LTS runs with PHP version 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6. Therefore, it is possible that some users install and execute the "Extension Compatibility Check" extension in a system which runs PHP version 5.3. Unfortunately, the extension is incompatible with this version of PHP.

Current solution: none (I know a possible soltuion - please contact me if you run TYPO3 CMS 6.2 LTS on PHP version 5.3).


Upgrade from TYPO3 CMS 7.6 LTS to 8.x
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "Extension Compatibility Check" extension supports the upgrade process from TYPO3 CMS version 6.2 LTS to 7.6 LTS only. A check for an upgrade from TYPO3 CMS 7.6 LTS to 8.x is *currently* not supported by this extension. The **next** TYPO3 CMS version that runs out of support is version 6.2 LTS. Therefore, the focus of this extension is on this TYPO3 CMS version.

However, I understand the need for 7.6 to 8.x upgrades and I consider updating the extension and make it more flexible in this regards.

Current solution: none
