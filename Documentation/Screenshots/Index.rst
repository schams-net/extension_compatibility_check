Make sure the extension list is up-to-date (go to the Extension Manager to update the list as required).
Click button "continue" **(3)** to proceed to the next step.

A list of all currently installed extension is shown on the second page. The red or green square **(4)** left-hand-side indicates if an extension is install and activated (*green*) or just installed, but currently not activated (*red*). The column marked **(5)** shows the currently installed version in the system. The column marked **(6)** shows with which versions of TYPO3 CMS the currently installed extension version is compatible (see section ":ref:`system-requirements`" for further details).
